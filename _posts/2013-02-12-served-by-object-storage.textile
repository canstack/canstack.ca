One of the things I would like to do with CanStack is try to at least serve the website and blog via "cloud" technologies. Currently the main website is running out of a Canadian OpenStack cloud. And now, this blog is being served by "Amazon S3":http://aws.amazon.com/s3/ which is an object storage system that can serve static files such as websites.

It was surprisingly easy to setup this site on S3, so if there are people out there who are unsure as how to use object storage, I encourage you to take another look. The "s3cmd makes syncing directories":http://s3tools.org/s3cmd-sync pretty easy. Hosting a website is not the best application of object storage, but it's one that most people can wrap their heads around, and provides a good entry into using the technology.

Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any Canadian object storage providers that can also provide the functionality of serving static websites via http. If anyone knows of any, please let me know and I would be happy to move this blog to their service.

Over the next while I'll be writing some blog posts about OpenStack and other cloud-related issues, as well as improving the look of the blog, so check back every once and a while. You can also follow CanStack on "twitter":http://twitter.com/canstack.

Thanks,
