h1. {{ page.title }}

On Thursday, April 25th, 2013, we had a small group of people call in from across Canada.

h2. What we talked about

h3. OpenStack Summit

Both Joe and Anita attended the OpenStack summit. Joe was one of the initial contributors to the "OpenStack Operations Guide":http://docs.openstack.org/ops/ and was in a "panel discussion":http://www.openstack.org/summit/portland-2013/session-videos/presentation/panel-writing-the-openstack-operations-guide-in-5-days at the summit on the guide. He also recently contributed a ton of documetnation to the "OpenStack Basic Install Guide":http://docs.openstack.org/grizzly/basic-install/apt/content/ for Grizzly.

Anita, who currently works at eNovance, was also interviewed a "couple":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp9XCMArwgE&list=PLenh213llmcbzniwrQd4GmFoZiKYxTZcR&index=29 of times, in part dicussing women in technology.

Some of the things we touched on:

* NetApp perhaps moving away from iSCSI to NFS for supporting OpenStack from a storage perspective
* Keystone seemed to be pushing towards PKI
* Multi-region
* CloudScaling's disucssions on using ZFS and Linux

h2. Next meeting

We hope to have a guest speaker next meeting, and Anita is working on that.

We are also hoping to connect with the "Toronto OpenStack Users group":http://www.meetup.com/OpenStackTO/ so if anyone reading this post has any connections with them, please let us know. :)

Thanks,
